# TZX-Duino-Amplifier-for-ZX-Spectrum-2

This is a PCB design of an amplifier which will allow you to use a TZX Duino with a ZX Spectrum +2

Included in this repositry are the following

Gerber Files in a Zip format which can be used if you decide to get the PCB's manufactured from PCB manufacturers such as JLPCB

Eagle Brd and SCH files should you wish to modify the PCB layout in any way

A parts list which has order codes and prices from www.rapidonline.com (although as shipping is quite high from them you may find it cheaper to buy from ebay or Amazon)
the partslist and order codes will give you the actual components I used which should make it easier to find on other sites. As the minimum order for a PCB from JLPCB is 5 PCB's the parts list contains enough components for 5 fully populated PCB's

Images of the PCB layouts and schematics

I will be updating my blog with the instllaton of this PCB
